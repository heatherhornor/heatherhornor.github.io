		<h2>Never Eat At Home Again</h2>
		<h3>By Susan Smith </h3>

		<p>As my New Year's resolution in 2016, I voted to never again make a meal at home.

	<h2>The Art Of Doing Absolutely Nothing</h2>
	<h3>By José Peréz</h3>

	<p>Is your job taking too much ti1ne away from your rest and relaxation? Does your algebra homework keep you
		 up at night? I used to be in the same boat until I quit work and school and devoted myself to doing absolutely
		  nothing. Many people think that laziness is a vice, but I am here to tell you that it is an art.
